# capstone-project-cover-forest-type-udacity
This is my capstone project that I have built up in order to obtain my Machine Learning Nanodegree certificate (Udacity and co-created with Kaggle). The goal of this document is to face the forest cover type prediction problem by using random forest algorithm.
